## 1. Project Overview
### Project Name
Real-Time Environmental Monitoring System for Raspberry Pi

### Project Description
An embedded system developed for Raspberry Pi, integrating temperature/humidity monitoring, OLED data display, data storage, and voice interaction. Suitable for smart homes, greenhouses, and small - scale industrial monitoring. Uses C++ for hardware drivers and Python for web services and voice functions, balancing performance and development efficiency.

### Core Advantages
- **Realtime Performance**: Thread prioritization and multi - threading ensure non - blocking sensor data collection and interface refresh.
- **Modular Design**: Separation of hardware drivers (DHT11, OLED) and software services (Web, Voice) for easy expansion and maintenance.
- **User Interaction**: Supports voice queries and anomaly alerts, reducing operational complexity.

## 2. Key Functional Features  

### 1. Real-Time Temperature/Humidity Monitoring  
- **Hardware Support**: DHT11 sensor (connected to GPIO4), with data validation and outlier filtering.  
- **Data Collection**:  
  - Real-time sampling at 1-second intervals, implemented via `readData()` in `dht11.cpp` for sensor communication and checksum verification.  
  - Returns `std::nullopt` on validation failure to avoid invalid data entry.  
- **Threshold Alerts**:  
  - Temperature: 10°C ~ 40°C, Humidity: 20% ~ 95%.  
  - Voice warnings ("Current temperature is too high, please ventilate!") and OLED flashing for out-of-range values.  

### 2. OLED Visualization  
- **Hardware Connection**: 128x32 I2C OLED display (GPIO2/SDA, GPIO3/SCL).  
- **Display Content**:  
  - **Time**: Real-time date (YYYY-MM-DD) on page 0.  
  - **Temperature**: 0.1°C precision, format: "TEMPERATURE: X.X°C" (page 2).  
  - **Humidity**: 0.1% precision, format: "HUMIDITY: X.X%" (page 4).  
- **Refresh Mechanism**: Auto-clears and redraws data every 60 seconds for clarity.

### 3. Data Storage & Web API  
- **Local Storage**:  
  - Data stored in `sensor_data.json` (JSON format), retaining up to 1000 historical records.  
  - Includes timestamp, temperature, and humidity fields, supporting resume on breakpoint and file recovery.  
- **Web Services**:  
  - Flask-based RESTful API:  
    - **POST /data**: Upload real-time data (Content-Type: application/json).  
    - **GET /data**: Retrieve historical data for frontend display or analysis.

### 4. Voice Interaction System  
- **Speech Recognition**:  
  - The system is activated by the wake - word "computer" and supports both English and Chinese voice commands.
  - It can accurately recognize queries such as "What's the humidity?" or "Exit system". During tests on the Raspberry Pi 3B, the response time was under 1.5 seconds, ensuring a quick and efficient interaction experience.
- **Speech Synthesis**:  
  - Leveraging the `webkitSpeechRecognition` and `SpeechSynthesisUtterance` web APIs for voice feedback, offering a smooth and browser - compatible solution.
  - The speech rate can be adjusted according to user preferences, with a default setting of 150 words per minute. The volume can also be easily tweaked.
  - In case of environmental anomalies, the system will automatically broadcast warnings. For example, if the humidity drops below 20%, it will announce "Warning: Humidity below 20%, please increase humidity!"


## 3. Technical Architecture & Implementation  

### 1. Hardware Architecture  
| Component       | Model/Specification | Function               | Connection       |  
|-----------------|---------------------|------------------------|------------------|  
| Main Board      | Raspberry Pi 3B (4GB)| System control         | N/A              |  
| Sensor          | DHT11               | Temp/humidity collection| GPIO4 (BCM)      |  
| Display         | 128x32 OLED         | Data visualization     | I2C (GPIO2/SDA, GPIO3/SCL) |

### 2. Software Architecture  
```  
Raspberry Pi OS (Raspbian)  
├─ C++ Hardware Driver Layer  
│  ├─ DHT11 Class (dht11.h/cpp): Sensor communication and data validation  
│  └─ OLED Class (oled.h/cpp): I2C protocol and text rendering  
├─ Python Service Layer  
│  ├─ Flask Web Server (server.py): Data storage and API  
│  └─ Web(index.html/web): Web and voice modules
└─ Main Program (main.cpp): Multi-thread integration of drivers and services  
```  

### 3. Key Technical Points  
- **Multi-Threading**:  
  - `std::async` in `main.cpp` starts Web server and voice assistant in the background, avoiding blocking the sensor collection loop.  
  - Highest thread priority for sensor reading (`set_max_priority`) to ensure realtime response.  
- **Memory-Mapped GPIO**:  
  - Direct GPIO register access via `mmap` in `dht11.cpp` for high-speed communication (requires root privileges).  
- **Cross-Language Collaboration**:  
  - C++ for high-performance hardware drivers, Python for I/O-bound tasks (network requests, speech synthesis), balancing efficiency and development speed.
